## Exercise

How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we specify which fields to use as a filter for our data?
- How do we specify comparisons on filter fields?
