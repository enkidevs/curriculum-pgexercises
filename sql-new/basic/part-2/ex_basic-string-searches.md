## Exercise

How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we specify which field(s) to use for filtering data?
- How do we specify that we want to filter on only part of a word?
