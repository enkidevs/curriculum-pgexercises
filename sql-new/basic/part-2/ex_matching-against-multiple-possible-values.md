## Exercise

How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the `OR` operator.

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we specify filtering our data on a list of values?
- How do we specify which columns we want from the table?
