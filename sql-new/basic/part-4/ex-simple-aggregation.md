# Simple aggregation

## Exercise

You'd like to get the signup date of your last member. How can you retrieve this information?

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we specify that we want the maximum value in a column?
- How would you guess we can ask for the minimum, average and sum of a column?
