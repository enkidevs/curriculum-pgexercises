## Exercise

You'd like to get the first and last name of the last member(s) who signed up - not just the date. How can you do that?

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we specify a single row should be returned by our query?
- How do we specify which columns we want from the table?
