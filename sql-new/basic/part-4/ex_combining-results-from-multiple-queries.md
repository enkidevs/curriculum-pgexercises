# Combining results from multiple queries

---
## Exercise

You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names. Yes, this is a contrived example :-). Produce that list!

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we combine the results from multiple queries?
- How do we remove duplicates while combining results from multiple queries?
