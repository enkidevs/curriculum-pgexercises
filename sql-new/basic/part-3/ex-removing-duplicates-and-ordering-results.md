# Removing duplicates, and ordering results

---
## Exercise

How can you produce an ordered list of the first 10 surnames in the members table? The list must not contain duplicates.

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we remove duplicates from our data using a SQL query?
- How do we limit the number of rows we return from our query?
