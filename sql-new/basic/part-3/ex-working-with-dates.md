---
## Exercise

How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we filter by date values?
- How do we find rows with a date that occurs between two other dates?
