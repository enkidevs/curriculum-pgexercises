# Classify results into buckets

## Exercise

How can you produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as 'cheap' or 'expensive' depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is more than $100? Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.

Once you have edited the query, review with your pair which parts of the query you edited to accomplish the task.

### Discuss:
- How do we specify conditional statements in our query statement?
- How can we group our data using the `SELECT` statement?
